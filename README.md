## What, Why, How
Hub is an application that former and current NHS patients can view events created by the NHS.  An NHS worker can post events using the web view.  

NHS events can easily go unnoticed by former and current patients.

Service users can install an iPhone app, built in *React Native*.  NHS workers can post events using a web view built using *handlebars.js*.
*Node, Hapi and Redis* were used on the back-end.
